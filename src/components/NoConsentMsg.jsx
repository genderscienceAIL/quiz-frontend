        The lack of female role models and the persistent use of gendered and
        stereotyped language holds female students back from pursuing a career
        in scientific disciplines, and also slows down women in academia.
        Including female role models in your classes is not just fair, but also
        encourages young female students to pursue professional careers in
        scientific related fields. We have prepared a set of freely available
        slides "
